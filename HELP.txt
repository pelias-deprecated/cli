usage: pelias --help | <subcommand>[#<tag>] <script> [scriptArgs]

`pelias` is a lightweight tool that abstracts away all of the Pelias
repositories behind one CLI, so that users no longer have to worry about
cloning, installing, and generally dealing with multiple moving parts in
different places (like the API, schema, and various importers). The tool
accepts two parameters: the repository to target, and the script inside it to
run. `pelias api start` will target the `start` script inside the
`github.com/pelias/api` repository. The scripts themselves are defined on a
per-repository basis inside `pelias-cli`.

Repositories will be stored inside `~/.pelias/`. When one is invoked and isn't
found locally, it'll be cloned and `npm install`'d; otherwise, the tool will
check for upstream changes and pull them in/reinstall packages if necessary.

	--help: Print this help message and exit.
	<subcommand>: The name of the repository under github.com/pelias/ to target.
	[<tag>]: A specific commit hash, branch name, or tag to `git checkout`
		inside the <subcommand> repo.
	<script>: The script defined inside the <subcommand> repo's package.json to
		run.  If missing, all available scripts will be listed.
	[args]: Any args to pass to <script>

Examples:

	pelias api start
	pelias geonames#a04dfe import
	pelias openstreetmap#experimental-branch import
