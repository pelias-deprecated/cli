# pelias-cli
A command-line tool for all of Pelias. Installing and using Pelias is cumbersome because it's highly distributed,
meaning that users often have to deal with a number of different repositories to import datasets, run the API, or
refresh elasticsearch types. `pelias-cli` abstracts away the process of installing and running the individual moving
parts.

## install
Just drop `pelias` into your `PATH`.

## usage

```
pelias --help
```
